# Java document classification

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Java document classification".

It's purpose is to classify text documents into categories using machine learning algorithms and search for documents using a search algorithm.

## Idea

A web application that uses machine learning algorithms to classify text documents into different categories. The application should use a trie data structure to store the vocabulary and a matrix to store the document-term frequencies. The application should also implement a search algorithm to find the most relevant documents for a given query.

## Learning

- Java
- GRASP
- SOLID
- Patterns
- Trie
- Matrix
- Machine learning algorithms
- Search algorithms.

## Requirements

- A user must be able to search for documents using a categorie.
- A user must be able to search for documents using text inside that document.
- A user should be able to search for documents that are related to a certain keyword.
